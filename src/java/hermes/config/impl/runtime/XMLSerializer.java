/**

 * This object coordinates the overall marshalling efforts across different
 * content-tree objects and different target formats.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following CFG gives the proper sequence of method invocation.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MARSHALLING  :=  ELEMENT
 * ELEMENT      :=  "startElement" NSDECL* "endNamespaceDecls"
 *                        ATTRIBUTE* "endAttributes" BODY "endElement"
 * 
 * NSDECL       :=  "declareNamespace"
 * 
 * ATTRIBUTE    :=  "startAttribute" ATTVALUES "endAttribute"
 * ATTVALUES    :=  "text"*
 * 
 * 
 * BODY         :=  ( "text" | ELEMENT )*
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A marshalling of one element consists of two stages. The first stage is
 * for marshalling attributes and collecting namespace declarations.
 * The second stage is for marshalling characters/child elements of that element.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Observe that multiple invocation of "text" is allowed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Also observe that the namespace declarations are allowed only between
 * "startElement" and "endAttributes".

     * If the method is called more than once, those texts are considered

     * Similarly, this method can be called after the endAttributes
     * method to marshal texts inside elements. The same rule about
     * multiple invokations apply to this case, too. For example,
